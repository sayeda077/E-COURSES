#E-COURSES
The project is about to learn some courses and enhance the knowledge. The proposed system is a web-based system where students are required to do a registration to start the free courses. They can enroll the courses which they want. In the course part there will be at first the introduction part, by clicking next from this page student can see the video of that particular course. There will be an admin login also. Admin can add the courses from the admin menu, also admin can update and delete the courses. After completing a course student will get a certificate for that specific course.
